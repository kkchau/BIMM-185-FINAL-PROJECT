## Predicting Pathogenicity using Aberrant Splicing Predictions of Single Nucleotide Variants in Autism Spectrum Disorder
#### Is it possible to use the likelihood that an SNV causes aberrant splicing to predict that SNVâ€™s pathogenicity in the context of Autism Spectrum Disorder?

* Hypothesis: Using a Bayesian inference model, the likelihood that a SNV causes aberrant splicing (like cassette exon skipping) can be used to predict the presence of the disease phenotype when that SNV targets a gene co-expression network hub
